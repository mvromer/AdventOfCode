# Advent of Code

Here you will find my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). I originally
started doing these in 2017 shortly after starting grad school but have since gone back to complete
those published in prior years as well as complete those that I missed while completing grad school.

Beyond simply completing each of the puzzles, I have and continue to use the Advent of Code as a
means for me to broaden my skills. Each year I try to pick a different language to use for solving
that year's Advent calendar of coding challenges. Moreover, I try to solve the challenges using the
idioms of that year's language. Sometimes I don't always stick to my chosen language; for example,
in 2020 when I decided to use F#, I actually went back to C# in solving one of the graph-oriented
puzzles, mainly because I could not come up with an idiomatic way of writing a graph-based solution
in F#.

In the end, my goal is to have fun and learn something new along the way each year.
